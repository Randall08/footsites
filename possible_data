document.getElementById and Ajax post

The idea is that the link is above, actionURL
And then use the postAjaxForm function to post it to the server ans then get the inventory?
also not know what does document.getElement do, need to look into the destroyer file again

http://www.footlocker.com/combine?type=js&files=shared/tipped/tipped.js,shared/scripts/jquery.bgiframe.pack.js,
shared/scripts/ajax.js,shared/scripts/common.js,shared/search/scripts/sizesearch.js&locale=en_US&ver=v16_11.4
.4-rc1&cd=1d

I think this is very similar to the destroyer's request from demandware
